            Walter Hendrik Gustav Lewin (born January 29, 1936) is a Dutch astrophysicist and retired professor of
            physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Lewin earned his doctorate in nuclear physics in 1965
            at the Delft University of Technology and was a member of MIT's physics faculty for 43 years beginning in
            1966 until his retirement in 2009.

            Lewin's contributions in astrophysics include the first discovery of a rotating neutron star through all-sky
            balloon surveys and research in X-ray detection in investigations through satellites and observatories.
            Lewin has received awards for teaching and is known for his lectures on physics and their publication online
            via YouTube, MIT OpenCourseWare and edX.
